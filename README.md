# Colônia Treze Against Cancer, a front end exercise

This front-end project is part of my final evaluation in a package of integrated courses from the University of Michigan, called "Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding", which was offered by the Coursera platform.

**This is the link to the course:** [Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design)

This project is a portfolio in which I chose to define as a theme a research and extension project in which I participated during high school, called Colônia Treze Against Cancer, which developed several activities in my region.
